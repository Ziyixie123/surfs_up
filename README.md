# Week-9-Challenge

## Overview of the analysis:
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, generate date and temperature in June and December from the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database.  Then, convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

## Result 
  1.	Juneâ€™s average temperature is 74.94, while the average temperature in December is 71.04. There is not much gap between summer and winter regarding the temperature.
  2.	Std of temperature is 3.25 in June and 3.74 in December, which means the temperature variation is similar between Summer and Winter.
  3.	The gap between the lowest temperature is larger in winter than in the summer.



## Summary 
We can tell that the temperature is relatively stable during the year, although there may be a significant winter gap. The average temperature is around 70ish during the whole year, which is a promising result for those who want to open a surf business. However, we still do not know if June's temperature (usually is considered the hottest month in the year) has the highest temperature in that area. We also do not know if December's temperature (usually is considered the coldest month in the year) has the lowest temperature in that area.
Two other possible queries :
  Achieve the highest temperature for each year.
  Achieve the precipitation in June and December.
